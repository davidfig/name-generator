==============

Yopey Yopey's Fictional Name Generator as seen at http://yopeyopey.com/tools/names/

The code uses a MySQL database with a combination of HTML, Javascript, and PHP.

Rename sample_config.php to config.php and include your MySQL URL, username, and password. You need a pre-created database, the script will create the tables.

To create the database, open /populate.php (because it injests from flat files, you may need to run this from the command line so it doesn't timeout).
